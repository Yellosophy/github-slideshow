Hi I'm Phil Johnson. I enjoy tennis, overthrowing dictatorships, and watering my plants. I live in Dante's attic, and he lets me out to go to class. As an EE, I enjoy messing around with and designing hardware, but I'm also not too shabby at coding, I'll probably be playing a support character here.
