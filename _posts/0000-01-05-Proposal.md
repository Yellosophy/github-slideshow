title: "Proposal!  The Glove!"
---

The design we chose is a glove implementation.  The core PCB will rest on the back of the (right) hand, with the inputs being attached to the fingers.  The index finger is "flick-it", where a button or touch sensor is attached to the nail-region to record the user flicking a surface.  The middle finger will be "roll-it", where a potentiometer or other rotation-dectection device will be attached to the pad of the finger to record the user dragging their finger on the table.  Lastly, ring finger is "blow-it", where the user blows on a sensor at the tip of the finger to record an input.  The power switch and other requirements will be attached to the PCB resting on the back of the hand.
